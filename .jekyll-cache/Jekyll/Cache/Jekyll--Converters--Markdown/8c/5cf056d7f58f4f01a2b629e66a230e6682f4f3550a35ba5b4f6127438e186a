<h2 id="buying-bitcoin-in-hong-kong">Buying Bitcoin in Hong Kong</h2>

<p>The options on how to buy Bitcoin can be overwhelming at first. Unlike with centralized systems like Alipay or Paypal there is no ‚Äòofficial‚Äô way to fund your accounts, and fees vary across services and locations. As a rule of thumb, the more convenient and fast a HKD -&gt; Bitcoin exchange is, the higher the fees are.</p>

<p>Compared with selling Bitcoin, there is little fraud risk associated with buying.
Unfortunately Bitcoin still does not have the legal status in Hong Kong that it deserves, and banks are reluctant to deal with companies and individuals associated with Bitcoin. In this environment it is easy for scammers to attempt to defraud you of your Dollars or Bitcoin in certain kinds of transactions.</p>

<h3 id="in-person">In Person</h3>

<p>As banks are more aggressively acting against Bitcoin companies, trading bitcoin in person has become more popular again in Hong Kong recently. The website <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/hkd/ 18 listings">localbitcoins.com</a> as well as the platform <a href="https://paxful.com/">Paxful</a>. If you just need a few dollars worth to ‚Äòtry it out‚Äô or ‚Äòplay with‚Äô or need help setting up or operating your wallet, you will likely find somebody to trade at the regular <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-HK/">Bitcoin meetups</a>.</p>

<p>Some OTC exchanges (see below) also deal with cash deposits and withdrawals. Clarify with your exchange or traders beforehand what currencies, notes and payment forms they accept.</p>

<h3 id="bitcoin-atms">Bitcoin ATMs</h3>

<p>The most convenient way to buy Bitcoin is an ATM. Usually you only need to show the ATM the QR code of your Bitcoin address, insert bank notes and confirm the exchange rate. The process takes less than 30 seconds, is anonymous but can cost up to 8% in fees. Prepare your wallet ahead of time, and bring exact change. ATMs generally accept only HKD bank notes, some insist on the first note being of HKD 500 denomination or above.</p>

<h3 id="bitcoin-exchanges">Bitcoin Exchanges</h3>

<p>Buying Bitcoin on exchanges is usually the cheapest option in terms of fees and is relatively fast and convenient too. But it often requires a few days to set up an account and get verified, and you can expect exchanges based in Hong Kong to ask for your personal information like HKID or address proof before you can start using their accounts.
Please note that Bitcoin exchanges are not to be treated as banks. We recommend you to withdraw your coins quickly after your purchase to a wallet you control, and never keep any funds on an exchange for a longer time.</p>

<h4 id="hong-kong-exchanges">Hong Kong Exchanges</h4>

<p>There are currently four exchanges with local Hong Kong bank accounts. Some of these exchanges also accept cash deposits and cheques.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.tidebit.com/">Tidebit</a></strong>

<h4 id="otc-exchanges">OTC Exchanges</h4>

<p>For larger amounts, you can go to an OTC Exchange, or broker. A broker will give you a quick quote for a single trade, usually upwards of 10 BTC. You will be able to sell or buy Bitcoin against a wire transfer.</p>

<p>Some exchanges overseas serve the Hong Kong market. Wire transfers to these exchanges are more expensive, but often more reliable and there is significantly more market depth.

It is up to the user to follow the appropriate Anti-Money-Laundering and Know-Your-Customer rules. The Bitcoin are held in escrow by the exchange. It‚Äôs very important to make use of these escrow options and be careful who you interact with.</p>

<h3 id="earn-bitcoin">Earn Bitcoin</h3>

<p>The by far cheapest way to get Bitcoin is to accept them as payment. No matter if you run a business, are employed, do freelance work or your friends owe you money, it may be a good idea to ask for these payments to be made in Bitcoin. Especially online and in international transfers the instantaneous and near-free Bitcoin transactions are far superior to other means.</p>

<p>If you have a business, you can consider accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. <a href="https://www.bitcoinhk.org/accept-bitcoin-now/">Learn all about it here.</a></p>
