<p>â€œItâ€™s not about Bitcoin, itâ€™s about the underlying technology.â€ While Bitcoin without doubt has had extraordinary success among all of the currently available blockchains, it suffers from a poor image, banks and regulators staying clear of it and internal conflicts about further innovation and direction. To what extend can other blockchains surpass Bitcoin? What are â€˜private blockchainsâ€™, and what can we expect when banks are declaring they are â€˜exploring blockchain technology?â€™
Our panelists have a diverse background in finance and provide you with great insights and views into an emerging new economy.</p>
