## Let's Talk About Code

The Bitcoin Devs meetup is a technical event intended for programmers, developers and technical people. If you want to come and hang out with us, please join us for our casual hangout, which will happen around the corner shortly after!

Special guest: Jimmy Song, Bitcoin Core Contributor and former VP of Engineering at Armory. He will dive into the details of Schnorr Signatures, Bellare-Neven and MuSig.

Please be aware that our venue has a very limited capacity. Please RSVP early and don't forget to update if you cannot make it.

Jimmy is in town to host the [Programming Blockchain seminar](http://programmingblockchain.com/). [You can find his blog here.](https://medium.com/@jimmysong)
