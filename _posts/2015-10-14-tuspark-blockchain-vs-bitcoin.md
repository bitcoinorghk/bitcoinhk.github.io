### #6, October 14: Blockchain vs Bitcoin (panel)
"It's not about Bitcoin, it's about the underlying technology." While Bitcoin without doubt has had extraordinary success among all of the currently available blockchains, it suffers from a poor image, banks and regulators staying clear of it and internal conflicts about further innovation and direction. To what extend can other blockchains surpass Bitcoin? What are 'private blockchains', and what can we expect when banks are declaring they are 'exploring blockchain technology?'
Our panelists have a diverse background in finance and provide you with great insights and views into an emerging new economy.
