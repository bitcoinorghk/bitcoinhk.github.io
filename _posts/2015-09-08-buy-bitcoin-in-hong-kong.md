## Buying Bitcoin in Hong Kong

[請按此查看中文版本。](https://比特幣.組織.香港/buy-bitcoin-in-hong-kong/)

The options on how to buy Bitcoin can be overwhelming at first. Unlike with centralized systems like Alipay or Paypal there is no 'official' way to fund your accounts, and fees vary across services and locations. As a rule of thumb, the more convenient and fast a HKD -> Bitcoin exchange is, the higher the fees are.

Compared with selling Bitcoin, there is little fraud risk associated with buying.
Unfortunately Bitcoin still does not have the legal status in Hong Kong that it deserves, and banks are reluctant to deal with companies and individuals associated with Bitcoin. In this environment it is easy for scammers to attempt to defraud you of your Dollars or Bitcoin in certain kinds of transactions.

No matter how you buy your Bitcoin, always insist on having your Bitcoin delivered to your personal wallet. We do not recommend to keep Bitcoin on exchanges, with your broker, on trading platforms or as 'IOUs.' Always insist on having your Bitcoin sent to your personal Bitcoin wallet, which should not be an app provided by your exchange or broker.

### Your Bitcoin wallet

You can download a Bitcoin wallet on your phone and computer or buy a hardware wallet. Only download apps from trusted sources, such as the App Store and Play Store. Buy your hardware wallet only from authorized resellers or directly from the manufacturer.

You should set up your wallet yourself. It will generate a backup 'seed' containing 12-24 words for you. **Store this phrase carefully, as anybody with access to it will be able to steal your funds.** DO not upload this phrase to the internet and do not share it with others. If you lose your phone, computer or hardware wallet you will be able to restore your funds using this seed.

### In Person

As banks are more aggressively acting against Bitcoin companies, trading bitcoin in person has become more popular again in Hong Kong recently. The website [localbitcoins.com](https://localbitcoins.com/buy-bitcoins-online/hkd/) as well as the platform [Paxful](https://paxful.com/) provide plenty of offers to buy and sell. If you just need a few dollars worth to 'try it out' or 'play with', you will likely find somebody to trade at the regular [Bitcoin meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-HK/).

Some OTC exchanges (see below) also deal with cash deposits and withdrawals. Clarify with your exchange or traders beforehand what currencies, notes and payment forms they accept.

### Bitcoin ATMs

The most convenient way to buy Bitcoin is an ATM. Usually you only need to show the ATM the QR code of your Bitcoin address, insert bank notes and confirm the exchange rate. The process takes less than 30 seconds, is anonymous but can cost up to 8% in fees. Prepare your wallet ahead of time, and bring exact change. ATMs generally accept only HKD bank notes, some insist on the first note being of HKD 500 denomination or above.

There are currently over 100 Bitcoin ATMs in Hong Kong, and their location is frequently changing.

You can find an up-to-date map of Hong Kong Bitcoin ATMs and their operators through [Coin ATM Radar](https://coinatmradar.com/city/74/bitcoin-atm-hong-kong/)

### Bitcoin Exchanges

Buying Bitcoin on exchanges is usually the cheapest option in terms of fees and is relatively fast and convenient too. But it often requires a few days to set up an account and get verified, and you can expect exchanges based in Hong Kong to ask for your personal information like HKID or address proof before you can start using their accounts.
Please note that Bitcoin exchanges are not to be treated as banks. We recommend you to withdraw your coins quickly after your purchase to a wallet you control, and never keep any funds on an exchange for a longer time.

### Earn Bitcoin

The by far cheapest way to get Bitcoin is to accept them as payment. No matter if you run a business, are employed, do freelance work or your friends owe you money, it may be a good idea to ask for these payments to be made in Bitcoin. Especially online and in international transfers the instantaneous and near-free Bitcoin transactions are far superior to other means.

If you have a business, you can consider accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. [Learn all about it here.](https://www.bitcoinhk.org/accept-bitcoin-now/)
