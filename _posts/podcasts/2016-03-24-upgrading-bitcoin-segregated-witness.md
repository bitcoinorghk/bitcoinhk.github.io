In this episode, we’ll be sharing a recording of [a talk we organized and hosted with the Tuspark Global Network on March 16, 2016][1]. We were very lucky to have Bitcoin Core Contributor Dr. Johnson Lau onsite to explain Segregrated Witness to us.

Johnson holds a PHD in Public Health and is a statistician that teaches at a medical school here in Hong Kong. He’s been involved in Bitcoin for the past four years and is closely involved in the development of the Bitcoin Protocol. He was a key player in the Bitcoin Roundtable held here in Hong Kong in February of 2016 helping bridge the gap between miners and developers to reach consensus. Johnson is also the co-author of BIPs 141, 142 and 143.
