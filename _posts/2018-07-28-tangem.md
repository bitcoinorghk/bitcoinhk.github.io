## What is a Tangem note?

Tangem is a NFC hardware wallet. Each tangem note contains a NFC chip with a secure element. While more advanced and secure, it is similar in functionality to your Octopus card. The chip contains the private key to a Bitcoin address. This private key cannot be extracted from the card.

You can use an NFC-enabled smart phone to verify the authenticity of the Tangem note, check its balance and send or receive Bitcoin. ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/tangem-lite/id1354868448)) ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tangem.wallet))

## What can you do with a Tangem Note?

- Store Bitcoin securely, all you need to do is protect the physical note
- Gift Bitcoin to those unfamiliar with it, they only need to keep the physical note safe
- Cash out at one of the many stores buying and selling Tangem notes, such as the [Genesis Block](https://www.genesisblockhk.com/)
- Develop your own functionality on [top of Tangem](https://github.com/TangemCash/tangem-lite), for example to identify guests or members and to give away digital assets
