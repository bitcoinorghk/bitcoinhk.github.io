Impressions from our Plug and Pay event with [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/hong-kong) at the great Sai Ying Pun coworking space Platform.

Focus of the event was to assist people with getting bitcoin wallets and making their first transactions.

The 50 HKD of entrance fee was entirely reimbursed to users in Bitcoin, who could then use them to buy drinks at the bar.

Hong Kong Bitcoin exchange [ANX](https://anxbtc.com/) provided us with their Bitcoin ATM.
