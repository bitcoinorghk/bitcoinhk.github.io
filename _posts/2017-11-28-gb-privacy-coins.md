### Privacy Coins

Date: **November 28, 2018 19:00 - 21:00**     
Location: Genesis Block, 1/F, Kwong Wah Building, **269-273 Hennessy Road**, Wan Chai, Hong Kong     
(Entrance on **Graham Street**)     

Speaker:

**Christina Chu** (Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong)

Privacy and anonymity are not only nice features, but fundamental to the functionality of any bearer asset. No cryptocurrency can have value without being fungible, and only privacy can guarantee fungibility. Are Bitcoin's privacy guarantees enough for it to survive? Or do we need better, more robust technologies? This talk explores the alternatives that promise to make cryptocurrencies more private.

- Dash (concept of coinjoin, proof of stake, governance, usage)
- ZCash (concept of zero knowledge proofs, governance, usage)
- Monero (concept of ring signatures, view keys, fungibility, governance, usage)
- Grin (concept of Mimblewimble, governance, usage, current experiences on Test Net)
