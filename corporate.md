## History

The Bitcoin Association has been accepting corporate members since 2017/2018. Corporate members enjoy much of the same benefits as individual members, with the exception of passive and active voting rights in the general assembly.

## Become a corporate member

The Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong is open to all corporates, organizations and societies from around the world.

We take the integrity of the association and community in high regard. We may reject your application on any grounds, including negative community perception, lack of visible business activity or disregard for community standards.

Becoming a member gives you access to the community and the association. You profit from discounted and exclusive networking and education events and help influence the quickly changing landscape of Bitcoin in Hong Kong.
